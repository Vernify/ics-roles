# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains Lightweight Architecture Decision Records (LADRs) documenting the architectural decisions made for the ICS Ansible Collection.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a central repository for architectural decisions, design patterns, and technical guidelines that govern the development and structure of the ICS Ansible Collection.

## LADR Format

All architectural decisions should be documented using the following format:

```markdown
# LADR-XXX: Decision Title

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [List of decision makers]

## Context

Brief description of the situation and problem that led to this decision.

## Decision

The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change.

## Alternatives Considered

Other options that were considered and why they were not chosen.
```

## Current ADRs

- [LADR-001: Collection Structure](001-collection-structure.md)
- [LADR-002: Variable Naming Conventions](002-variable-naming.md)
- [LADR-003: Multi-OS Support Strategy](003-multi-os-support.md)
- [LADR-004: Secret Management Integration](004-secret-management.md)

## Guidelines

1. **Keep it Concise**: LADRs should be brief but comprehensive
2. **Version Control**: All LADRs are version controlled with the collection
3. **Review Process**: New LADRs require review by the infrastructure team
4. **Update Status**: Mark superseded or deprecated decisions appropriately
